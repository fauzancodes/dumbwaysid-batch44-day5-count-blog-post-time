        <h1>Hi! Welcome to my hut</h1>
        <p>
          Greeting! I'm Fauzan, a man with a Geophysical Engineering educational background who is in the early stages of becoming a Fullstack Developer. Curious why I switched from Geophysical Engineering to Fullstack Developer? Here's the short story.
          <br/><br/>
          Geophysics is a science used in the field of natural resources, especially in the search for natural resources. Meanwhile, in Indonesia itself, currently, most of natural resource companies are not in the search stage, but are in the stage of taking and developing the natural resource fields that have been found. This makes it difficult for me to pursue a career in Geophysics.
          <br/><br/>
          Then I did a research, is there any other field that I like more than Geophysical Engineering. I tried Graphic Design, Data Science and Web Development. And the result is that I feel a greater sense of love in Web Development. Do you like playing games? I find this feeling like when playing games, you know, it's like don't care about time, don't care about sleeping, don't care about eating, even if our wives are spoiling teasing us beside us we can easily ignore it, Lol &#128518;. I got that feeling in Web Development.
          <br/><br/>
          That's why now I'm starting to study at <a href="https://dumbways.id/" target="_blank">Dumbways.id</a>. Here I was taught the knowledge to become a Fullstack Developer, starting from basic knowledge to advance through theory and practice with extraordinary friends and mentors. I hope we can soon be able to work together on a big project that has many benefits.
